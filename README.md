○ Full Name
Hi, my name is Bernard Jezua R. Tandang!

○ Degree Program
I am currently a sophomore taking up B.S. Computer Science! :D

○ Live Website Link:
https://cmsc100-1s2324.github.io/my-github-page-rebberchicken/

○ Steps on how to create GitHub page:
- If this is in general, then go to your Repository > Create the entry file > Settings > Find Pages > Under "GitHub Pages", check whether the site is deployed.
- As for the steps on how I finished the webpage:
1. I used the sample wireframe in the given exercise handout as my basis.
2. Used flex boxes taught during class for the panels in the header, featured photo, experience, skills, autobiography, and footer.
3. Checked whether the sizes of the flex boxes were correct by initializing a white background color.
4. Once the sizes were okay, I added designs via CSS. The font I used was imported via Google Fonts API.
5. I had a checklist on which parts should I do first and this was in order from easiest to hardest:
   Header -> Footer -> Featured Photo -> Skills & Autobiography -> Experience
6. It took me a long time to finish the experience panels since I wanted them to have an image overlay hover effect.
7. I went for a minimalistic approach in terms of design.

Key features to note:
- Keyframe transition animation in logo and navigation bar list
- Fade in animation for featured photo
- Transition animation when experience panels are hovered
- Change in color when anchor elements are hovered (e.g. nav bar, footer links)

○ What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
My key takeaway for this exercise are the following:
1. Git really helps in terms of documenting and restoring certain progress of the work.
2. The syntax of HTML and CSS can be a bit confusing, but there are plenty of resources online that will help developers like me out!
3. I feel like if I was given more time to accomplish this, I would have come up with a better design. But then again, this week has already been tiring and as of now, there is still no electricity to where I live in. :')
4. I had fun reminiscing my HTML and CSS lessons back in CMSC 12, and I do hope I get to learn more about CMSC 100!

Sincerely,
Bernard Jezua R. Tandang
