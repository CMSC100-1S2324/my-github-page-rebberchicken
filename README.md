○ Full Name
Hi, my name is Bernard Jezua R. Tandang!

○ Degree Program
I am currently a sophomore taking up B.S. Computer Science! :D

○ Live Website Link:
https://cmsc100-1s2324.github.io/my-github-page-rebberchicken/

○ Steps on how to create GitHub page:
- If this is in general, then go to your Repository > Create the entry file > Settings > Find Pages > Under "GitHub Pages", check whether the site is deployed.
- As for the steps on how I finished the webpage:
1. I used the sample wireframe in the given exercise handout as my basis.
2. Used flex boxes taught during class for the panels in the header, featured photo, experience, skills, autobiography, and footer.
3. Checked whether the sizes of the flex boxes were correct by initializing a white background color.
4. Once the sizes were okay, I added designs via CSS. The font I used was imported via Google Fonts API.
5. I had a checklist on which parts should I do first and this was in order from easiest to hardest:
   Header -> Footer -> Featured Photo -> Skills & Autobiography -> Experience
6. It took me a long time to finish the experience panels since I wanted them to have an image overlay hover effect.
7. TBA

○ What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
